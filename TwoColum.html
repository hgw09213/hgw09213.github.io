        League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games.
        Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.
        Since its release in October 2009, League has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization.
        The game is available for Microsoft Windows and macOS.
